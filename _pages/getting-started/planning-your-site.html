  <h1>Drupal Basic Building concepts</h1>
  <p>To full comprehend the power of drupal, you will need understand the below concepts.</p>
  <h2>Node</h2>
  <p> A node is a entity of content data, which can consist of text, HTML markup, images, attached files, and other data that is intended to be displayed to site visitors. For each identified piece of content, the user can create a content type in consideration to where and how the content will be used and edited on the site. By default Drupal provides a Page, Article and comments content types. ACERWC Website has the following content types defined.</p>

  <p><img src="assets/images/create-node.png" alt="Add Node"/></p>
  
  <h2>View</h2>
  <p>A view is a listing of content on a website. Drupal's core Views module handles the display of views, and the core Views UI module allows you to create and edit them in the administrative interface. When you define views, you are interested in taking data from your website and displaying it to the user. </p>
  <p>You can create views to output practically any content entity that is stored in the system. For example, you can create the following lists for the country missions, DAC event etc.</p>
  <p> A listing created by a view can be in any of the following forms: </p>
  <ul class="itemizedlist">
    <li class="listitem"> Table with sortable fields</li>
    <li class="listitem">Grid layouts</li>
    <li class="listitem">Teasers or pictures that link to articles</li>
    <li class="listitem">Blocks</li>
    <li class="listitem">JSON output</li>
    <li class="listitem">RSS feeds</li>
    <li class="listitem">Calendars</li>
    <li class="listitem">On-screen slideshows</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Block</h2>
  <p>Blocks are individual pieces of your site’s web page layout. They are placed inside the regions of your theme, and can be created, removed, and rearranged in the Block layout (admin/structure/block) administration page. Examples of blocks include the Who’s online listing, the main navigation menu, and the breadcrumb trail. The main page content is also a block. </p>
  <p>Some modules make new blocks available for placement on your site. For example, when the core Search module is installed and configured, it provides a block that contains a search form. You may also create and place your own custom blocks. </p>  
  <p><img src="assets/images/regions.png" alt="blocks"/></p>
  <p>Each block has its own configuration settings, which allow you to select which pages of your site will display the block. It is even possible to place multiple copies of a block, each with its own separate configuration and visibility rules.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/block-configurations.png" alt="block configurations"/></p>
  <p>You can also create a custom block for things like footer data etc (admin/structure/block => custom block library)</p>

  <h2>Region</h2>
  <p>Besides its primary content, a web page contains other content such as site branding (site name, slogan, and logo), navigation aids (menus, links, and icons), formatted text, and images. Each theme provides a set of named regions, such as Header, Content, and Sidebar, where site builders may choose to place their content. </p>
  <p>The available regions depend on the theme design. Only the Content region, which contains the primary content, is required; others are optional. ACERWC Website them has been configured with this layout and regions. (admin/structure/block => Demonstrate block regions)</p>

  <h2>Menu</h2>
  <p>Menus are a collection of links used to navigate a website. The core Menu UI module provides an interface to control and customize the menu system. Menus are primarily displayed as a hierarchical list of links. By default, new menu links are placed inside a built-in menu labeled Main navigation, but administrators can also create custom menus.</p>

  <p>Adding a Page to the Navigation </p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/basic-page-menu.png" alt="Add Menu Link from page"/></p>
  
  <h2>People</h2>
  <p>Anyone who visits your website is a user, including you. There are three groups of users:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Users who are not logged in, or anonymous users.</li>
    <li>Users who are logged in, or authenticated users.</li>
    <li>The administrative user account that was automatically created when you installed your site.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><img src="assets/images/people-1.png" alt="People"/></p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/people.png" alt="People"/></p>
  <p>Everything is simple, a table with users and a button to add a new user. If you need to sort users by roles or by date of addition, then just click on the title of the required field</p>
